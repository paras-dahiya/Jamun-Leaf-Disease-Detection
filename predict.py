The use of disease free seeds, crop rotation, the elimination of volunteer plants and weed hosts, and the restriction of overhead watering to keep leaves dry are all effective means of preventing the spread of common blight. In addition to these, you can use a copper based fungicide on crops.'

Before watering your plant, check the soil with your finger, and if 2 to 3 inces of soil surface is dry, it is the time to water it. Morning hours are good for watering plants.

Use 1 tablespoon of household liquid detergent per gallon of water and spray it on the plants. Wait 15 minutes, then wash the detergent solution off with a strong stream of water.
